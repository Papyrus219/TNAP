Night 2

*End of the fnaf add*

hello... uh... hello-jello!

Uh... welcome back to your... Second night and uh... unpaid internship!
You survived the first night (or at least I hope so)... uh... colour me Impressed!

So... uh... Welcome to Part 2 of the training manual!
There were a few things that... uh... I forgot to mention before...
Well at least today I won't have to improvise... uh... so I can just MIMIC
what the paper says...

Ohh! Yeah... uh... I missed out on a crucial part! At around 3AM,
the OP's tend to get a bit more... uhh... Feral.
That drastically decreases your uh... chances of survival...

*Turns back as a sound of doors opening and closing plays*
Hey! You got me my coffee? 
*mumbling*
No?
Be positive Cegielka... be positive...
*mumbling*

*I turn back*
Oh!!! I forgot to mention!
uhh... You have a limited supply of powers in the backup generator things... or something...
I am not uhh... an Engineer or an Electrician... so I don't know how it works... uh...
but I know that for some reason the doors open when you run out of battery... so uhh...
That proves that this game should not be taken seriously nor have "ANY LORE"!

But I am sure an employee like yourself can handle all that!

*Clears his throat*

uhh... To the animatronic section, I guess!

First we have our quiet and mysterious star, Bot!
Bot will move unless you look or leave the camera looking at him!
The guy is suprisinglt fast so... uhh... mind that...
He will pose quite a danger with mr. Meme because you will need to not look at Bot
To feed the Mimic... *mumbling* I mean... uh the Mememan!!!


Alright so our second OP will be... Lightnate...
I'll be honest... As I am quite new here I don't know a lot about them...
But not to worry, intern! He may be quiet but he takes his long time to... uh...
arrive... they will wander on the right side of you... I would be wary of both doors...
Papyrus is still active, whilst Lightnate attacks!

*I turn back*

Hey! Look at this encyption method I have!
You take a letter and turn it into morse!
Then you add the dots and lines together!
a dot is one and the line is two!

How cool is that?

*mumbling*

You're not bright either you know?
*I sigh*

I wonder if OP-01 will be happy with the improved style of manual!

*mumbling*

What do you mean it is still not perfect?

*long sigh*

You are going for a lasagna tomorrow?
